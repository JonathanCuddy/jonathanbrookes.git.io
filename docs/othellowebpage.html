			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Roderigo and Iago. </h2>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">O never tell me! I take it much unkindly <br />That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse <br />As if the strings were thine, shou1dst know of this. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Sblood, but you will not hear me. <br />If ever I did dream of such a matter, <br />Abhor me. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou told’st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city, <br />In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, <br />Off-capp’d to him; and, by the faith of man, <br />I know my price, I am worth no worse a place. <br />But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, <br />Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance <br />Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war, <br />And, in conclusion, <br />Nonsuits my mediators; for, “Certes,” says he, </p>
			<p class="verseline">“I have already chose my officer.” <br />And what was he? <br />Forsooth, a great arithmetician, <br />One Michael Cassio, a Florentine </p>
			<p class="verseline">(A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife) <br />That never set a squadron in the field, <br />Nor the division of a battle knows <br />More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, <br />Wherein the toged consuls can propose <br />As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice <br />Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election; <br />And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof <br />At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds <br />Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d <br />By debator and creditor. This counter-caster, <br />He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, <br />And I -God bless the mark!- his Moorship’s ancient. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, there’s no remedy. ‘Tis the curse of service, <br />Preferment goes by letter and affection, <br />And not by old gradation, where each second <br />Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself <br />Whether I in any just term am affined <br />To love the Moor. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">I would not follow him then. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, sir, content you. <br />I follow him to serve my turn upon him: <br />We cannot all be masters, nor all masters <br />Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark <br />Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, <br />That doting on his own obsequious bondage <br />Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass, <br />For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d. <br />Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are <br />Who, trimm’d in forms and visages of duty, <br />Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves <br />And throwing but shows of service on their lords <br />Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats <br />Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul, <br />And such a one do I profess myself. <br />For, sir, <br />It is as sure as you are Roderigo, <br />Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago. <br />In following him, I follow but myself; <br />Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, <br />But seeming so, for my peculiar end. <br />For when my outward action doth demonstrate <br />The native act and figure of my heart <br />In complement extern, ‘tis not long after <br />But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve <br />For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe, <br />If he can carry’t thus! </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Call up her father, <br />Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight, <br />Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen, <br />And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, <br />Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy, <br />Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t <br />As it may lose some color. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Here is her father’s house; I’ll call a loud. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell <br />As when, by night and negligence, the fire <br />Is spied in populous cities. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho! </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves! <br />Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags! <br />Thieves! Thieves! </p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Brabantio appears above, at a window. </h2>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">What is there a son of this terrible summons? <br />What is the matter there? </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Signior, is all your family within? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Are your doors lock’d? </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why? Wherefore ask you this? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Zounds, sir, you’re robb’d! For shame, put on your gown; <br />Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; <br />Even now, very now, an old black ram <br />Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise! <br />Awake the snorting citizens with the bell, <br />Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you. <br />Arise, I say! </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">What, have you lost your have wits? </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Most reverend signior, do you know my voice? </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Not I. What are you? </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">My name is Roderigo. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">The worser welcome. <br />I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors. <br />In honest plainness thou hast heard me say <br />My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness, <br />Being full of supper and distempering draughts, <br />Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come <br />To start my quiet. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Sir, sir, sir- </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">But thou must needs be sure <br />My spirit and my place have in them power <br />To make this bitter to thee. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Patience, good sir. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">What tell’st thou me of robbing? This is Venice; <br />My house is not a grange. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Most grave Brabantio, <br />In simple and pure soul I come to you. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="prose">‘Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">What profane wretch art thou? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="prose">I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou are a villain. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">You are- a senator. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Sir, I will answer anything. But, I beseech you, <br />If’t be your pleasure and most wise consent, <br />As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter, <br />At this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night, <br />Transported with no worse nor better guard <br />But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, <br />To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor- <br />If this be known to you, and your allowance, <br />We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs; <br />But if you know not this, my manners tell me <br />We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe <br />That, from the sense of all civility, <br />I thus would play and trifle with your reverence. <br />Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, <br />I say again, hath made a gross revolt, <br />Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes <br />In an extravagant and wheeling stranger <br />Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself: <br />If she be in her chamber or your house, <br />Let loose on me the justice of the state <br />For thus deluding you. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Strike on the tinder, ho! <br />Give me a taper! Call up all my people! <br />This accident is not unlike my dream; <br />Belief of it oppresses me already. <br />Light, I say, light! </p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exit above. </h2>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Farewell, for I must leave you. <br />It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, <br />To be produced- as, if I stay, I shall- <br />Against the Moor; for I do know, the state, <br />However this may gall him with some check, <br />Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d <br />With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, <br />Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls, <br />Another of his fathom they have none <br />To lead their business; in which regard, <br />Though I do hate him as I do hell pains, <br />Yet for necessity of present life, <br />I must show out a flag and sign of love, <br />Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him, <br />Lead to the Sagittary the raised search, <br />And there will I be with him. So farewell.Exit. </p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter, below, Brabantio, in his nightgown, and Servants with torches. </h2>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">It is too true an evil: gone she is, <br />And what’s to come of my despised time <br />Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, <br />Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl! <br />With the Moor, say’st thou? Who would be a father! <br />How didst thou know ‘twas she? O, she deceives me <br />Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers. <br />Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you? </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Truly, I think they are. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! <br />Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds <br />By what you see them act. Is there not charms <br />By which the property of youth and maidhood <br />May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, <br />Of some such thing? </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yes, sir, I have indeed. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Call up my brother. O, would you had had her! <br />Some one way, some another. Do you know <br />Where we may apprehend her and the Moor? </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">I think I can discover him, if you please <br />To get good guard and go along with me. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Pray you, lead on. At every house I’ll call; <br />I may command at most. Get weapons, ho! <br />And raise some special officers of night. <br />On, good Roderigo, I’ll deserve your pains. </p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exeunt. </h2>

			<h2 class="location">Another street </h2>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Othello, Iago, and Attendants with torches. </h2>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Though in the trade of war I have slain men, <br />Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ the conscience <br />To do no contrived murther. I lack iniquity <br />Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times <br />I had thought to have yerk’d him here under the ribs. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis better as it is. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, but he prated <br />And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms <br />Against your honor <br />That, with the little godliness I have, <br />I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir, <br />Are you fast married? Be assured of this, <br />That the magnifico is much beloved, <br />And hath in his effect a voice potential <br />As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you, <br />Or put upon you what restraint and grievance <br />The law, with all his might to enforce it on, <br />Will give him cable. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Let him do his spite. <br />My services, which I have done the signiory, <br />Shall out-tongue his complaints. ‘Tis yet to know- <br />Which, when I know that boasting is an honor, <br />I shall promulgate- I fetch my life and being <br />From men of royal siege, and my demerits <br />May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune <br />As this that I have reach’d. For know, Iago, <br />But that I love the gentle Desdemona, <br />I would not my unhoused free condition <br />Put into circumscription and confine <br />For the sea’s worth. But, look! What lights come yond? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Those are the raised father and his friends. <br />You were best go in. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Not I; I must be found. <br />My parts, my title, and my perfect soul <br />Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? </p>

			<p class="verseline">By Janus, I think no. </p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Cassio and certain Officers with torches. </h2>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>

			<p class="character">Cassio </p>
			<p class="verseline">The Duke does greet you, general, <br />And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, <br />Even on the instant. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">What is the matter, think you? </p>
			<p class="character">Cassio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Something from Cyprus, as I may divine; <br />It is a business of some heat. The galleys <br />Have sent a dozen sequent messengers <br />This very night at one another’s heels; <br />And many of the consuls, raised and met, <br />Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly call’d for, <br />When, being not at your lodging to be found, <br />The Senate hath sent about three several quests <br />To search you out. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis well I am found by you. <br />I will but spend a word here in the house <br />And go with you. </p>

			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Signior, it is the Moor. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Down with him, thief! </p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">They draw on both sides. </h2>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. <br />Good signior, you shall more command with years <br />Than with your weapons. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter? <br />Damn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her, <br />For I’ll refer me to all things of sense, <br />If she in chains of magic were not bound, <br />Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy, <br />So opposite to marriage that she shunn’d <br />The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation, <br />Would ever have, to incur a general mock, <br />Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom <br />Of such a thing as thou- to fear, not to delight. <br />Judge me the world, if ‘tis not gross in sense <br />That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, <br />Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals <br />That weaken motion. I’ll have’t disputed on; </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis probable, and palpable to thinking. <br />I therefore apprehend and do attach thee <br />For an abuser of the world, a practicer <br />Of arts inhibited and out of warrant. <br />Lay hold upon him. If he do resist, <br />Subdue him at his peril. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hold your hands, <br />Both you of my inclining and the rest. <br />Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it <br />Without a prompter. Where will you that I go <br />To answer this your charge? </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">To prison, till fit time <br />Of law and course of direct session <br />Call thee to answer. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>

When we consider <br />The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, <br />And let ourselves again but understand <br />That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes, <br />So may he with more facile question bear it, <br />For that it stands not in such warlike brace, <br />But altogether lacks the abilities <br />That Rhodes is dress’d in.

			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nothing, but this is so. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, <br />My very noble and approved good masters, <br />That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter, <br />It is most true; true, I have married her; <br />The very head and front of my offending <br />Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, <br />And little blest with the soft phrase of peace; <br />For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith, <br />Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used <br />Their dearest action in the tented field, <br />And little of this great world can I speak, <br />More than pertains to feats of broil and battle; <br />And therefore little shall I grace my cause <br />In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, <br />I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver <br />Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms, <br />What conjuration, and what mighty magic- <br />For such proceeding I am charged withal- <br />I won his daughter. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">A maiden never bold, <br />Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion <br />Blush’d at herself; and she- in spite of nature, <br />Of years, of country, credit, everything- <br />To fall in love with what she fear’d to look on! <br />It is judgement maim’d and most imperfect, <br />That will confess perfection so could err <br />Against all rules of nature, and must be driven <br />To find out practices of cunning hell <br />Why this should be. I therefore vouch again <br />That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood, <br />Or with some dram conjured to this effect, <br />He wrought upon her. </p>
			<p class="character">Duke </p>
			<p class="verseline">To vouch this is no proof, <br />Without more certain and more overt test <br />Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods <br />Of modern seeming do prefer against him. </p>
			<p class="character">First Senator </p>
			<p class="verseline">But, Othello, speak. <br />Did you by indirect and forced courses <br />Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections? <br />Or came it by request, and such fair question <br />As soul to soul affordeth? </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do beseech you, <br />Send for the lady to the Sagittary, <br />And let her speak of me before her father. <br />If you do find me foul in her report, <br />The trust, the office I do hold of you, <br />Not only take away, but let your sentence <br />Even fall upon my life. </p>

			<p class="verseline">And till she come, as truly as to heaven <br />I do confess the vices of my blood, <br />So justly to your grave ears I’ll present <br />How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love <br />And she in mine. </p>
			<p class="character">Duke </p>
			<p class="verseline">Say it, Othello. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her father loved me, oft invited me, <br />Still question’d me the story of my life <br />From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, <br />That I have pass’d. <br />I ran it through, even from my boyish days <br />To the very moment that he bade me tell it: <br />Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, <br />Of moving accidents by flood and field, <br />Of hair-breadth ‘scapes i’ the imminent deadly breach, <br />Of being taken by the insolent foe <br />And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence <br />And portance in my travels’ history; <br />Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, <br />Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven, <br />It was my hint to speak- such was the process- <br />And of the Cannibals that each other eat, <br />The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads <br />Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear <br />Would Desdemona seriously incline; <br />But still the house affairs would draw her thence, <br />Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, <br />She’ld come again, and with a greedy ear <br />Devour up my discourse; which I observing, <br />Took once a pliant hour, and found good means <br />To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart <br />That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, <br />Whereof by parcels she had something heard, <br />But not intentively. I did consent, <br />And often did beguile her of her tears <br />When I did speak of some distressful stroke <br />That my youth suffer’d. My story being done, <br />She gave me for my pains a world of sighs; <br />She swore, in faith, ‘twas strange, ‘twas passing strange; </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Twas pitiful, ‘twas wondrous pitiful. <br />She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d <br />That heaven had made her such a man; she thank’d me, <br />And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, <br />I should but teach him how to tell my story, <br />And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: <br />She loved me for the dangers I had pass’d, <br />And I loved her that she did pity them. <br />This only is the witchcraft I have used. <br />Here comes the lady; let her witness it. </p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Desdemona, Iago, and Attendants. </h2>
			<p class="character">Duke </p>
			<p class="verseline">I think this tale would win my daughter too. <br />Good Brabantio, <br />Take up this mangled matter at the best: <br />Men do their broken weapons rather use <br />Than their bare hands. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">I pray you, hear her speak. <br />If she confess that she was half the wooer, <br />Destruction on my head, if my bad blame <br />Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress. <br />Do you perceive in all this noble company <br />Where most you owe obedience? </p>
			<p class="character">Desdemona </p>
			<p class="verseline">My noble father, <br />I do perceive here a divided duty. <br />To you I am bound for life and education; <br />My life and education both do learn me <br />How to respect you; you are the lord of duty, <br />I am hitherto your daughter. But here’s my husband, <br />And so much duty as my mother show’d <br />To you, preferring you before her father, <br />So much I challenge that I may profess <br />Due to the Moor, my lord. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">God be with you! I have done. <br />Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs; <br />I had rather to adopt a child than get it. <br />Come hither, Moor. <br />I here do give thee that with all my heart <br />Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart <br />I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, <br />I am glad at soul I have no other child; <br />For thy escape would teach me tyranny, <br />To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. </p>
			<p class="character">Duke </p>
			<p class="verseline">Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence <br />Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers <br />Into your favor. <br />When remedies are past, the griefs are ended <br />By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. <br />To mourn a mischief that is past and gone <br />Is the next way to draw new mischief on. <br />What cannot be preserved when Fortune takes, <br />Patience her injury a mockery makes. <br />The robb’d that smiles steals something from the thief; <br />He robs himself that spends a bootless grief. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>
			<p class="verseline">So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; <br />We lose it not so long as we can smile. <br />He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears <br />But the free comfort which from thence he hears; <br />But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow <br />That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. <br />These sentences, to sugar or to gall, <br />Being strong on both sides, are equivocal. <br />But words are words; I never yet did hear <br />That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. <br />I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state. </p>
			<p class="character">Duke </p>
			<p class="prose">The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. </p>
			<p class="prose">Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">The tyrant custom, most grave senators, <br />Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war <br />My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize <br />A natural and prompt alacrity <br />I find in hardness and do undertake <br />These present wars against the Ottomites. <br />Most humbly therefore bending to your state, <br />I crave fit disposition for my wife, <br />Due reference of place and exhibition, <br />With such accommodation and besort <br />As levels with her breeding. </p>
			<p class="character">Duke </p>
			<p class="verseline">If you please, <br />Be’t at her father’s. </p>
			<p class="character">Brabantio </p>

			<p class="verseline">Nor I. I would not there reside <br />To put my father in impatient thoughts <br />By being in his eye. Most gracious Duke, <br />To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear, <br />And let me find a charter in your voice <br />To assist my simpleness. </p>
			<p class="character">Duke </p>
			<p class="verseline">What would you, Desdemona? </p>
			<p class="character">Desdemona </p>
			<p class="verseline">That I did love the Moor to live with him, <br />My downright violence and storm of fortunes <br />May trumpet to the world. My heart’s subdued <br />Even to the very quality of my lord. <br />I saw Othello’s visage in his mind, <br />And to his honors and his valiant parts <br />Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. <br />So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, <br />A moth of peace, and he go to the war, <br />The rites for which I love him are bereft me, <br />And I a heavy interim shall support <br />By his dear absence. Let me go with him. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Let her have your voices. <br />Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not <br />To please the palate of my appetite, <br />Nor to comply with heat- the young affects <br />In me defunct- and proper satisfaction; <br />But to be free and bounteous to her mind. <br />And heaven defend your good souls, that you think <br />I will your serious and great business scant <br />For she is with me. No, when light-wing’d toys <br />Of feather’d Cupid seel with wanton dullness <br />My speculative and officed instruments, <br />That my disports corrupt and taint my business, <br />Let housewives make a skillet of my helm, <br />And all indign and base adversities <br />Make head against my estimation! </p>

			<p class="prose">Virtue? a fig! ‘Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. </p>
			<p class="prose">Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions. </p>
			<p class="prose">But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to be a sect or scion. </p>

I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration-put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle </p>
			<p class="prose">Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoyher- therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her. </p>

Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyselfa pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered.

			<p class="verseline">What from the cape can you discern at sea? </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood; <br />I cannot, ‘twixt the heaven and the main, <br />Descry a sail. </p>
			<p class="character">Montano </p>
			<p class="verseline">Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land; <br />A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements. <br />If it hath ruffian’d so upon the sea, <br />What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, <br />Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this? </p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">A segregation of the Turkish fleet. <br />For do but stand upon the foaming shore, <br />The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds; <br />The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, <br />Seems to cast water on the burning bear, <br />And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole. <br />I never did like molestation view <br />On the enchafed flood. </p>

			<p class="verseline">News, lads! Our wars are done. <br />The desperate tempest hath so bang’d the Turks, <br />That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice <br />Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance <br />On most part of their fleet. </p>
			<p class="character">Montano </p>
			<p class="verseline">How? Is this true? </p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">The ship is here put in, <br />A Veronesa. Michael Cassio, <br />Lieutenant to the warlike Moor, Othello, <br />Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea, <br />And is in full commission here for Cyprus. </p>
			<p class="character">Montano </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am glad on’t; ‘tis a worthy governor. </p>

			<p class="character">Montano </p>
			<p class="verseline">Pray heavens he be, <br />For I have served him, and the man commands <br />Like a full soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho! <br />As well to see the vessel that’s come in <br />As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, <br />Even till we make the main and the aerial blue <br />An indistinct regard. </p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman </p>

			<p class="character">Cassio </p>
			<p class="verseline">His bark is stoutly timber’d, and his pilot <br />Of very expert and approved allowance; <br />Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, <br />Stand in bold cure. </p>

			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis one Iago, ancient to the general. </p>
			<p class="character">Cassio </p>
			<p class="verseline">He has had most favorable and happy speed: <br />Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, <br />The gutter’d rocks, and congregated sands, <br />Traitors ensteep’d to clog the guiltless keel, <br />As having sense of beauty, do omit <br />Their mortal natures, letting go safely by <br />The divine Desdemona. </p>

			<p class="verseline">She that I spoke of, our great captain’s captain, <br />Left in the conduct of the bold Iago, <br />Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts <br />A se’nnight’s speed.

			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am about it, but indeed my invention <br />Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze; <br />It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse labors, <br />And thus she is deliver’d. <br />If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, <br />The one’s for use, the other useth it. </p>
			<p class="character">Desdemona </p>

			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">She that was ever fair and never proud, <br />Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, <br />Never lack’d gold and yet went never gay, <br />Fled from her wish and yet said, “Now I may”; <br />She that, being anger’d, her revenge being nigh, <br />Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly; <br />She that in wisdom never was so frail <br />To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tall; <br />She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind, <br />See suitors following and not look behind; <br />She was a wight, if ever such wight were- </p>

If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good.

O my sweet, <br />I prattle out of fashion, and I dote <br />In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago, <br />Go to the bay and disembark my coffers. <br />Bring thou the master to the citadel; <br />He is a good one, and his worthiness <br />Does challenge much respect.

If thou best valiant-as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them- list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="prose">With him? Why, ‘tis not possible. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="prose">Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties- all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none- a slipper and subtle knave, a finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself-a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="prose">I cannot believe that in her; she’s full of most blest condition. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="prose">Blest fig’s-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been blest, she would never have loved the Moor. Blest pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that? </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="prose">Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister. </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="prose">Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you. Provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. </p>
			<p class="verseline">So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means </p>

			<p class="verseline">That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it; <br />That she loves him, ‘tis apt and of great credit. <br />The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, <br />Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, <br />And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona <br />A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too, <br />Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure <br />I stand accountant for as great a sin, <br />But partly led to diet my revenge, <br />For that I do suspect the lusty Moor <br />Hath leap’d into my seat; the thought whereof <br />Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards, <br />And nothing can or shall content my soul <br />Till I am even’d with him, wife for wife. <br />Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor <br />At least into a jealousy so strong <br />That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do, <br />If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace <br />For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, <br />I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, <br />Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb </p>

I am sorry <br />For your displeasure, but all will sure be well. <br />The general and his wife are talking of it, <br />And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies <br />That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus <br />And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom <br />He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you <br />And needs no other suitor but his likings <br />To take the safest occasion by the front <br />To bring you in again. </p>

Good my lord, <br />If I have any grace or power to move you, <br />His present reconciliation take; <br />For if he be not one that truly loves you, <br />That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, <br />I have no judgement in an honest face. <br />I prithee, call him back. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Went he hence now? </p>
			<p class="character">Desdemona </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, sooth; so humbled <br />That he hath left part of his grief with me <br />To suffer with him. Good love, call him back. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time. </p>

			<p class="verseline">Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn, <br />On Tuesday noon, or night, on Wednesday morn. <br />I prithee, name the time, but let it not <br />Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent; <br />And yet his trespass, in our common reason- <br />Save that, they say, the wars must make example <br />Out of their best- is not almost a fault <br />To incur a private check. When shall he come? <br />Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul, <br />What you would ask me, that I should deny, <br />Or stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio, <br />That came awooing with you, and so many a time <br />When I have spoke of you dispraisingly <br />Hath ta’en your part- to have so much to do <br />To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much- </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will; <br />I will deny thee nothing. </p>
			<p class="character">Desdemona </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, this is not a boon; </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, <br />Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, <br />Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit <br />To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit <br />Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, <br />It shall be full of poise and difficult weight, <br />And fearful to be granted. </p>

			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">But for a satisfaction of my thought; <br />No further harm. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why of thy thought, Iago? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">I did not think he had been acquainted with her. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, yes, and went between us very oft. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Indeed! </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discernist thou aught in that? <br />Is he not honest? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Honest, my lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Honest? Ay, honest. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">My lord, for aught I know. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">What dost thou think? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Think, my lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me, <br />As if there were some monster in his thought <br />Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. <br />I heard thee say even now, thou likest not that, <br />When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like? <br />And when I told thee he was of my counsel <br />In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed!” <br />And didst contract and purse thy brow together, <br />As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain <br />Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me, <br />Show me thy thought. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">My lord, you know I love you. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">I think thou dost; <br />And for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty <br />And weigh’st thy words before thou givest them breath, <br />Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more; <br />For such things in a false disloyal knave <br />Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just <br />They’re close dilations, working from the heart, <br />That passion cannot rule. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">For Michael Cassio, <br />I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">I think so too. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Men should be what they seem; <br />Or those that be not, would they might seem none! </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Certain, men should be what they seem. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, yet there’s more in this. <br />I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, <br />As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts <br />The worst of words. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Good my lord, pardon me; <br />Though I am bound to every act of duty, <br />I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. <br />Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false; <br />As where’s that palace whereinto foul things <br />Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure, <br />But some uncleanly apprehensions <br />Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit <br />With meditations lawful? </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, <br />If thou but think’st him wrong’d and makest his ear <br />A stranger to thy thoughts. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do beseech you- <br />Though I perchance am vicious in my guess, <br />As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague <br />To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy <br />Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet, <br />From one that so imperfectly conceits, <br />Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble <br />Out of his scattering and unsure observance. <br />It mere not for your quiet nor your good, <br />Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom, <br />To let you know my thoughts. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">What dost thou mean? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, <br />Is the immediate jewel of their souls. <br />Who steals my purse steals trash; ‘tis something, nothing; </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Twas mine, ‘tis his, and has been slave to thousands; <br />But he that filches from me my good name <br />Robs me of that which not enriches him <br />And makes me poor indeed. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">You cannot, if my heart were in your hand; <br />Nor shall not, whilst ‘tis in my custody. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ha! </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, beware, my lord, of jealousy! <br />It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock <br />The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss <br />Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; <br />But O, what damned minutes tells he o’er <br />Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves! </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">O misery! </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Poor and content is rich, and rich enough; <br />But riches fineless is as poor as winter <br />To him that ever fears he shall be poor. <br />Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend <br />From jealousy! </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, why is this? <br />Think’st thou lid make a life of jealousy, <br />To follow still the changes of the moon <br />With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt <br />Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat <br />When I shall turn the business of my soul <br />To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, <br />Matching thy inference. ‘Tis not to make me jealous <br />To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, <br />Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well; <br />Where virtue is, these are more virtuous. <br />Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw <br />The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; <br />For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago, <br />I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; <br />And on the proof, there is no more but this- <br />Away at once with love or jealousy! </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason <br />To show the love and duty that I bear you <br />With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound, <br />Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. <br />Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; <br />Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure. <br />I would not have your free and noble nature <br />Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to’t. <br />I know our country disposition well; <br />In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks <br />They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience <br />Is not to leave’t undone, but keep’t unknown. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Dost thou say so? </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">She did deceive her father, marrying you; <br />And when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks, <br />She loved them most. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">And so she did. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, go to then. <br />She that so young could give out such a seeming, <br />To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak- <br />He thought ‘twas witchcraft- but I am much to blame; <br />I humbly do beseech you of your pardon <br />For too much loving you. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am bound to thee forever. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>

			<p class="verseline">Not a jot, not a jot. </p>

			<p class="verseline">I’faith, I fear it has. <br />I hope you will consider what is spoke <br />Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved; <br />I am to pray you not to strain my speech <br />To grosser issues nor to larger reach <br />Than to suspicion. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">I will not. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Should you do so, my lord, <br />My speech should fall into such vile success <br />Which my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend- <br />My lord, I see you’re moved. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">No, not much moved. <br />I do not think but Desdemona’s honest. </p>

			<p class="verseline">Long live she so! and long live you to think so! </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">And yet, how nature erring from itself- </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, there’s the point, as- to be bold with you- <br />Not to affect many proposed matches <br />Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, <br />Whereto we see in all things nature tends- <br />Foh, one may smell in such a will most rank, <br />Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural. <br />But pardon me. I do not in position <br />Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear, <br />Her will, recoiling to her better judgement, <br />May fall to match you with her country forms, <br />And happily repent. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Farewell, farewell. <br />If more thou dost perceive, let me know more; <br />Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago. </p>

			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">[Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor <br />To scan this thing no further; leave it to time. <br />Though it be fit that Cassio have his place, <br />For sure he fills it up with great ability, <br />Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, <br />You shall by that perceive him and his means. <br />Note if your lady strain his entertainment <br />With any strong or vehement importunity; <br />Much will be seen in that. In the meantime, <br />Let me be thought too busy in my fears- <br />As worthy cause I have to fear I am- <br />And hold her free, I do beseech your honor. </p>

Haply, for I am black <br />And have not those soft parts of conversation <br />That chamberers have, or for I am declined <br />Into the vale of years- yet that’s not much- <br />She’s gone.

			<p class="verseline">If thou dost slander her and torture me, <br />Never pray more; abandon all remorse; <br />On horror’s head horrors accumulate; <br />Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed; <br />For nothing canst thou to damnation add <br />Greater than that. </p>

Take note, take note, O world, <br />To be direct and honest is not safe. <br />I thank you for this profit, and from hence <br />I’ll love no friend sith love breeds such offense. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest. </p>

			<p class="verseline">By the world, <br />I think my wife be honest, and think she is not; <br />I think that thou art just, and think thou art not. <br />I’ll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh <br />As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black <br />As mine own face. If there be cords or knives, <br />Poison or fire, or suffocating streams, <br />I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied! </p>

			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord? <br />Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on? <br />Behold her topp’d? </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Death and damnation! O! </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">It were a tedious difficulty, I think, <br />To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then, <br />If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster <br />More than their own! What then? how then? <br />What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction? <br />It is impossible you should see this <br />Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, <br />As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross <br />As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say, <br />If imputation and strong circumstances, <br />Which lead directly to the door of truth, <br />Will give you satisfaction, you may have’t. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">Give me a living reason she’s disloyal. </p>

			<p class="verseline">I do not like the office; <br />But sith I am enter’d in this cause so far, <br />Prick’d to’t by foolish honesty and love, <br />I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately <br />And, being troubled with a raging tooth, <br />I could not sleep. <br />There are a kind of men so loose of soul, <br />That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs; <br />One of this kind is Cassio. <br />In sleep I heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona, <br />Let us be wary, let us hide our loves”; <br />And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, <br />Cry, “O sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard, <br />As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots, <br />That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg <br />Over my thigh, and sigh’d and kiss’d; and then <br />Cried, “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor! </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">O monstrous! monstrous! </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>

			<p class="verseline">‘Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">And this may help to thicken other proofs <br />That do demonstrate thinly. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll tear her all to pieces. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done; <br />She may be honest yet. Tell me but this; <br />Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief <br />Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand? </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">I gave her such a one; ‘twas my first gift. </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">I know not that; but such a handkerchief- <br />I am sure it was your wife’s- did I today <br />See Cassio wipe his beard with. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">If it be that- </p>
			<p class="character">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline">If it be that, or any that was hers, <br />It speaks against her with the other proofs. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! <br />One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. <br />Now do I see ‘tis true. Look here, Iago, <br />All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis gone. <br />Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell! <br />Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne <br />To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, <br />For ‘tis of aspics’ tongues! </p>

			<p class="verseline">This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart; <br />Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires <br />A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer, <br />Much castigation, exercise devout, <br />For here’s a young and sweating devil here <br />That commonly rebels. ‘Tis a good hand, <br />A frank one. </p>
			<p class="character">Desdemona </p>
			<p class="verseline">You may, indeed, say so; <br />For ‘twas that hand that gave away my heart. </p>

			<p class="verseline">No, faith, my lord. </p>
			<p class="character">Othello </p>
			<p class="verseline">That’s a fault. That handkerchief <br />Did an Egyptian to my mother give; <br />She was a charmer, and could almost read <br />The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it, </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Twould make her amiable and subdue my father <br />Entirely to her love, but if she lost it <br />Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye <br />Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt <br />After new fancies. She dying gave it me, <br />And bid me, when my fate would have me wive, <br />To give it her. I did so, and take heed on’t; <br />Make it a darling like your precious eye; <br />To lose’t or give’t away were such perdition <br />As nothing else could match. </p>

I would not be delay’d. <br />If my offense be of such mortal kind <br />That nor my service past nor present sorrows <br />Nor purposed merit in futurity <br />Can ransom me into his love again, <br />But to know so must be my benefit; <br />So shall I clothe me in a forced content <br />And shut myself up in some other course <br />To Fortune’s alms. </p>

Nay, we must think men are not gods, <br />Nor of them look for such observancy <br />As fits the bridal.

			<p class="verseline">Good sir, be a man; <br />Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked <br />May draw with you. There’s millions now alive <br />That nightly lie in those unproper beds <br />Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better. <br />O, ‘tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock, <br />To lip a wanton in a secure couch, <br />And to suppose her chaste!

			<p class="verseline">Stand you awhile apart, <br />Confine yourself but in a patient list. <br />Whilst you were here overwhelmed with your grief- <br />A passion most unsuiting such a man- <br />Cassio came hither. I shifted him away, <br />And laid good ‘scuse upon your ecstasy; <br />Bade him anon return and here speak with me <br />The which he promised. Do but encave yourself <br />And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, <br />That dwell in every region of his face; <br />For I will make him tell the tale anew, <br />Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when <br />He hath and is again to cope your wife. <br />I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience, <br />Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, <br />And nothing of a man. </p>

			<p class="verseline">Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, <br />A housewife that by selling her desires <br />Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature <br />That dotes on Cassio, as ‘tis the strumpet’s plague <br />To beguile many and be beguiled by one. <br />He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain <br />From the excess of laughter. Here he comes. </p>

If you will watch his going thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him.

Let husbands know <br />Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell <br />And have their palates both for sweet and sour, <br />As husbands have. What is it that they do <br />When they change us for others? Is it sport? <br />I think it is. And doth affection breed it? <br />I think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs? <br />It is so too. And have not we affections, <br />Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? <br />Then let them use us well; else let them know, <br />The ills we do, their ills instruct us so. </p>
